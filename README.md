# PlantScannerDataset
This repository provides a curated subset of the MaizeLeaf Health Dataset, a video database capturing maize (Zea mays) plants under controlled conditions to facilitate automated detection of foliar diseases. This dataset supports research in computer vision, plant phenotyping, and machine learning-based agricultural diagnostics. The complete dataset encompasses high-resolution temporal visual data annotated at the leaf level for infection status (healthy vs. infected).
