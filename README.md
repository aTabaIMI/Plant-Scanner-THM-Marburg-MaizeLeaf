# PlantScannerDataset
This repository provides a curated subset of the MaizeLeaf Health Dataset, a video database capturing maize (Zea mays) plants under controlled conditions to facilitate automated detection of foliar diseases. The capturing and recording device is a plant scanner crafted and developed Faculty of Health Sciences, Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, while the lab environment with the controlled conditions and the plants grown and prepared in Center for Synthetic Microbiology (SYNMIKRO) and Department of Chemistry, University of Marburg. This dataset supports research in computer vision, plant phenotyping, and machine learning-based agricultural diagnostics. The complete dataset encompasses high-resolution temporal visual data annotated at the leaf level for infection status (healthy vs. infected).
